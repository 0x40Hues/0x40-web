# 0x40-web
A fairly complete HTML5/CSS3 Canvas + Web Audio clone of the 0x40 Hues Flash.

Should work on most modern browsers.

Example pages:  
[Default Hues](http://0x40.mon.im/)  
[420 Hues](http://420.mon.im/)  
[Halloween Hues](http://spook.mon.im/)

You can also have animations that sync perfectly with the beats of the songs. Inspired by Kepstin's Integral experiments.  
[420 Hues, Snoop Edition](http://420.mon.im/snoop.html)  
["Montegral"](http://0x40.mon.im/montegral.html)  

If you would like to know how to customise your own Hues, the 420 Snoop Hues contain almost all the configuration options you'd ever want to use.
A commented list of all possible settings is at the top of HuesSettings.js
